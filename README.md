> Toptive yeoman generator for python projects

## Getting Started

`generator-toptive-python` is a [yeoman-generator](https://yeoman.io/generators/) for python projects using setuptools. The generator creates a boilerplate code that support:

* a standard `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in`,
* project automation using `tox`,
* static code analysis and reports using `pylint` and `flake8`,
* unit test cases using `pytest`,
* system test cases using `robotframework`,
* documentation with `sphinx`,
* `.bumpversion` script,
* `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` and `.travis.yml`,
* template for github issues and report bugs,
* a docker image

### What's Yeoman?
[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) is a generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app. It allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

npm install -g generator-toptive-python
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo toptive-python
```
